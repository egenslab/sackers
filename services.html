                                        expertise earned over 15 years and in the last three years alone, we have assisted our clients with
                                        longevity swaps totalling £10bn. We are currently working on three longevity swaps for schemes in

                                    <p>DB consolidation continues to gain traction and ranges from shared services and asset pooling, to
                                        single governance models such as DB master trusts or transfers to DB superfunds, where the link with
                                        the sponsoring employer is cut. The superfund market is in its infancy but our team is actively involved
                                        in the anticipated first-wave discussions for transactions. We have advised on several transfers to
                                        DB master trusts, and our broad experience advising trustees of pension schemes, together with our
                                        industry involvement and expertise in general risk management solutions, means we are well-placed
                                        to advise in this nascent area.</p>

                                    <p>Completing a buy-out or other risk transfer transaction is not the end of a scheme’s journey.
                                        Scheme wind-up can itself prove complex, timely and challenging, with many multi-layered areas to
                                        be considered. Our team are highly experienced at navigating the road to wind-up efficiently and
                                        effectively for trustees, seeing the buy-out journey to completion.</p>

                                    <p>Trustees should consider their position and protections both during the buy-out and beyond. With
                                        the development of the trustee insurance market leading to fewer players and more carve-outs,
                                        trustees are thinking more about their future protections as part of any scheme exit. Our team is

                                    <p>Pension schemes are increasingly exploring how they can transfer the risks associated with
                                        their DB pension arrangements, whether to an insurance company, superfund, consolidator or
                                        through a longevity transaction. The last six years have seen an unprecedented increase in risk
                                        transfer activity and we have advised on some of the most significant transactions, including
                                        2021’s biggest annuity deal in the market. Our specialist team supports trustees and employers

                                    <p>Our team has been involved in the exercise of TPR’s powers right from the start, with its first
                                        financial support direction (Sea Containers) and one of its first scheme funding enforcement actions
                                        (EMI). We have continued to be involved in a variety of enforcement actions since then including
                                        trustee suspension and prohibition orders, investigations into auto-enrolment breaches, employer
                                        contribution breaches, improvement and third-party notices, and anti-avoidance enforcement
                                        action. As the pensions regulatory landscape continues to change, so too do the risks and governance
                                        challenges.  We have spoken and written widely in relation to TPR’s powers under the Pension

                                        in relation to significant and costly errors. Often such actions arise off the back of matters in which

                                        As schemes are increasingly at risk of data breaches and cyber attacks, they are also subject to
